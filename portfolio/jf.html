        <h2>THE BRAND</h2>
        <div class="explanation">
        	<p>Jami came to us in search of a brand for her psychotherapy practice. We worked with Jami to Ô¨Ånd her niche and developed a brand focusing on her thriving couples work. We hand-drew the icon, creating one shape that could be both a J and F. These letters come together, as couples do, to form one identity.</p>

    	<h2>THE WEB</h2>
        <p>We wanted to create a <a href="http://jamifaletti.com" target="_blank">website</a> for Jami that embodied the work she does. It feels clean, simple, and approachable. We mimicked the hand-drawn nature of the logo with an illustrated map of her location on the contact page. We wanted her clients to know who she is and what her driving philosophy is as soon as they entered the site. We assisted Jami with copywriting and user experience to ensure her clients understood her brand and knew how to get the information they needed.</p>

        	<p>"Free Agency's work is brilliant! Michelle acted as both a spirited collaborator and knowledgeable guide, allowing for a creative focus to naturally emerge. She interpreted my needs so intuitively that I was literally brought to tears by one of her designs. She captured very meaningful elements in my logo that I hadn't articulated or even been aware of, necessarily, until I saw them graphically expressed. In addition to her extraordinary creative chops, she is also a total pro and pleasure to work with. Truly gifted with respect to creativity and design, she is also professional, clear and timely in her approach to project management. Michelle comes to the table with exceptional expertise in graphic design, branding and marketing. She developed a unique stand-out-in-the-crowd brand that is so personal to me and my business. I now have a brand that I am proud of and inspired by!"</p>
