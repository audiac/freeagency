        <h2>THE BRAND</h2>
        <div class="explanation">
        	<p>Leanne was looking for a completely new look and feel for her wedding event company. The majority of her work is set in Santa Ynez Wine Country and Santa Barbara. We drew inspiration from the natural elements used in her work and created an identity that plays off the rustic charm of Soleil Events. The brand aesthetic pays homage to the hand-crafted detail put into each wedding.</p>

    	<h2>THE WEB</h2>
        <p class="explanation">Soleil Events website needed a complete overhaul. We decided to create a site that focused on showcasing the work Leanne does for her clients. We added a portfolio section which showcases several successful weddings. The portfolio uses large images that fill the screen and enables users to take in the intricate details of Soleil Events.</p>

        	<p>"I can never thank Free Agency enough for capturing exactly what I wanted, and the response has been phenomenal! Within a month of my new website going live, clients were calling specifically for me and my expertise in the wedding industry. Where once they would ask, "How much?", they're now asking, "Are you available on our date, and if so, we would like to hire you." It has only been 5 months and I have already booked twice that of any one of the previous 7 years. It was worth every penny!"</p>
