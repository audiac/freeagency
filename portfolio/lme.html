        	<p>Amy Edelstein came to us for the launch of her ﬁrst book to correspond with her online course. We used the beautiful paintings by Dorith Teichman which create a feeling of movement and creativity. We created an elegant and minimal book design for Love, Marriage & Evolution, focusing on readability and ﬂow. This workbook can be purchased on Amazon or downloaded <a href="http://amyedelstein.com/ebook-download-2" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

        	<p>"Free Agency delivers beautiful, professional work. Their design of my book crafted a work of art that echoed and represented the quality of the ideas within, and it's received enthusiastic response. Their expressive designs outlast superﬁcial trends and communicate in an uplifting way. My ongoing relationship with Free Agency is spearheaded by Michelle D'Avella&mdash;a creative, intuitive, and highly skilled designer. She's always managed to capture what I want to convey and on top of that, she is simply a delight to work with."</p>
