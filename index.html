                    <p>We all have dreams, things we want to bring to the world. But you’re 
                        different. You’re different because most people push those dreams 
                        aside. But you’re choosing to act on them. And because of that 
                        choice we’re able to help you bring your idea to life. We applaud 
                        you, risk taker. Welcome to the club.<br><br>Here's what we can help you with:</p>

                    <p>There’s something unique about you and what you’re doing, and 
                        we’re here to help you get clear on what exactly that is. We’ll get a 
                        solid understanding of your business goals, develop a strategy that 
                        serves as the foundation for all of our designs, and create a mood 
                        board to ensure we’re on the same page aesthetically. Then it’s time 
                        for us to turn the blank slate into your new brand.</p>

                    <h2>WEB DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                    <p>Your website is a platform for your brand. It’s the most important 
                        place a person will go to discover more about your brand. We 
                        help you determine the pages necessary for your website, how to 
                        position your brand in this medium, how to craft your brand’s voice, 
                        and how to enhance the user experience. Once your custom site 
                        design is complete and approved, we ship it out to one of our 
                        talented developers who turns the graphics into a working site. We 
                        oversee the entire process to ensure the designs you’ve approved 
                        are executed properly. We work with a variety of platforms&mdash;including 
                        WordPress.org&mdash;if you’re interested in maintaining your site yourself. 
                        Our goal is to create a custom online presence that represents the 
                        essence of your brand.</p>

                    <h2>PRINT</h2>
                    <p>There’s nothing quite like a beautifully-printed good. In an age 
                        growing increasingly more connected virtually, we believe the effort 
                        through print brings heart to the project. We’re capable of creating 
                        almost any print project but specialize in designing books (e-books, 
                        too), letterhead, ﬂyers, envelopes, business cards, and posters. We 
                        have several fantastic printers we recommend our clients utilize and 
                        also offer print management services for those who don’t want to 
                        handle it on their own.</p>

Within a month of my new website going live, clients were calling speciﬁcally for me and my expertise in the wedding industry. Where once they would ask, "How much?," they're now asking, "Are you available on our date, and if so, we would like to hire you." It has only been 5 months and I have already booked twice that of any one of the previous 7 years. It was worth every penny!"</p></li>

Their expressive designs outlast superﬁcial trends and communicate in an uplifting way.

Michelle acted as both a spirited collaborator and knowledgeable guide, allowing for a creative focus to naturally emerge. She interpreted my needs so intuitively that I was literally brought to tears by one of her designs.
